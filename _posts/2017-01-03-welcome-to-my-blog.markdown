Welcome to my exploratory blog. This will serve as an account of the concepts I deem fit for documentation.

Code snippets will be as follows:

``` ruby
def say_hello(name)
  puts "Hello, #{name}"
end
say_hello('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
```

This blog is powered by [Jekyll][jekyll]. Have a look at [Jekyllâ€™s GitHub repo][jekyll-gh] and should you have questions on Jerkyl
